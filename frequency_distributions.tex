\subsection{Frequency tables}
A frequency distribution is a table that shows “classes” or “intervals” of data 
entries with a count of the number of entries in each class. The frequency $f$ of 
a class is the number of data entries in the class. Each class will have a 
“lower class limit” and an “upper class limit” which can be interpreted as the 
lowest and highest numbers in each class. The “class width” is defined as the 
distance between the lower limits of consecutive classes. The range is the difference 
between the maximum and minimum data entries. Before constructing a frequency table, 
some consideration should be given about the range of values in the dataset. In 
situations where there are to many class intervals, the likelihood of reducing the 
bulkiness of the data is highly unlikely. On the other hand, if the total number 
of classes is minimal, then the shape of the distribution itself cannot be successfully 
determined. Generally, for most datasets 6–14 intervals is considered ideal.[2] However, 
this should not be interpreted as the defacto standard as a lot depends on the 
type of dataset. With that being said, the following are a few general guidelines 
one can follow when constructing a frequency table. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The ideal number of classes can be determined or approximated by the 
    formulas: $C = 1 + 3.3\log{n}$ (Sturge's formula) or $C = \sqrt{n}$ 
    (Square-root choice formula) where $n$ is the total number of observations in 
    the dataset. 
    \item Calculate the range of the data by finding the minimum and maximum data 
    values. 
    \item  Using the range of the data find the width of the classes, using the
    formula $h = \frac{\mbox{range}}{\mbox{number of classes}}$.
    \item To find the class limits use the minimum data entry as the lower limit 
    of the first class. Then to get the lower limit of the next class, add the 
    class width. Continue until you reach the last class. Then find the upper 
    limits of each class.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequency Distribution Graphs}
A frequency distribution graph is a diagrammatic illustration of the information 
in the frequency table. 

\subsubsection{Histogram}
A histogram is a graphical representation of the variable of interest in the X axis and the number of observations
(frequency) in the Y axis. Percentages can be used if the
objective is to compare two histograms having different
number of subjects. A histogram is used to depict the frequency
when data are measured on an interval or a ratio scale. Figure 1
depicts a histogram constructed for the data given in Table 1.
A bar diagram and a histogram may look the same but there
are three important differences between them:[3,4]
In a histogram, there is no gap between the bars as the variable
is continuous. A bar diagram will have space between the bars.
All the bars need not be of equal width in a histogram (depends
on the class interval), whereas they are equal in a bar diagram.
The area of each bar corresponds to the frequency in a
histogram whereas in a bar diagram, it is the height [Figure 1].

\subsubsection{Frequency polygon}
A frequency polygon is constructed by connecting all
midpoints of the top of the bars in a histogram by a straight
line without displaying the bars. A frequency polygon aids in
the easy comparison of two frequency distributions. When
the total frequency is large and the class intervals are narrow,
the frequency polygon becomes a smooth curve known as the
frequency curve. A frequency polygon illustrating the data in
Table 1 is shown in Figure 2.

\subsubsection{Box and whisker plot}
This graph, first described by Tukey in 1977, can also be
used to illustrate the distribution of data. There is a vertical
or horizontal rectangle (box), the ends of which correspond
to the upper and lower quartiles (75th and 25th percentile,
respectively). Hence the middle 50\% of observations are
represented by the box. The length of the box indicates the
variability of the data. The line inside the box denotes the
median (sometimes marked as a plus sign). The position of
the median indicates whether the data are skewed or not.
If the median is closer to the upper quartile, then they are
negatively skewed and if it is near the lower quartile, then
positively skewed.
The lines outside the box on either side are known as whiskers
[Figure 3]. These whiskers are 1.5 times the length of the
box, i.e., the interquartile range (IQR). The end of whiskers is
called the inner fence and any value outside it is an outlier. If
the distribution is symmetrical, then the whiskers are of equal
length. If the data are sparse on one side, the corresponding side
whisker will be short. The outer fence (usually not marked)
is at a distance of three times the IQR on either side of the
box. The reason behind having the inner and outer fence at
1.5 and 3 times the IQR, respectively, is the fact that 95\% of
observations fall within 1.5 times the IQR, and it is 99\% for
3 times the IQR.[5]

\subsubsection{Bubble Chart}
A Bubble Chart is a multi-variable graph that is a cross between a Scatterplot 
and a Proportional Area Chart. Like a Scatterplot, Bubble Charts use a Cartesian 
coordinate system to plot points along a grid where the X and Y axis are separate 
variables. However. unlike a Scatterplot, each point is assigned a label or 
category (either displayed alongside or on a legend). Each plotted point then 
represents a third variable by the area of its circle. Colours can also be used 
to distinguish between categories or used to represent an additional data variable. 
Time can be shown either by having it as a variable on one of the axis or by 
animating the data variables changing over time.

Bubble Charts are typically used to compare and show the relationships between 
categorised circles, by the use of positioning and proportions. The overall 
picture of Bubble Charts can be used to analyse for patterns/correlations. Too 
many bubbles can make the chart hard to read, so Bubble Charts have a limited 
data size capacity. This can be somewhat remedied by interactivity: clicking or 
hovering over bubbles to display hidden information, having an option to 
reorganise or filter out grouped categories. Like with Proportional Area Charts, 
the sizes of the circles need to be drawn based on the circle’s area, not its 
radius or diameter. Not only will the size of the circles change exponentially, 
but this will lead to misinterpretations by the human visual system.

\subsubsection{Multi-set Bar Chart}
Also known as a Grouped Bar Chart or Clustered Bar Chart. This variation of a Bar 
Chart is used when two or more data series are plotted 
side-by-side and grouped together under categories, all on the same axis. Like a 
Bar Chart, the length of each bar is used to show discrete, numerical comparisons 
amongst categories. Each data series is assigned an individual colour or a 
varying shade of the same colour, in order to distinguish them. Each group of 
bars are then spaced apart from each other. The use of Multi-set Bar Charts is 
usually to compare grouped variables or categories to other groups with those 
same variables or category types. Multi-set Bar Charts can also be used to compare 
mini Histograms to each other, so each bar in the group would represent the 
significant intervals of a variable. The downside of Multi-set Bar Charts is that 
they become harder to read the more bars you have in one group.
