Frequency distributions are visual displays that organize and present frequency 
counts so that the information can be interpreted more easily. Frequency distributions 
show the number of times a given quantity occurs in a set of data. The primary 
purpose of frequency distributions is to assist the researcher to make sense of 
the data collected.
